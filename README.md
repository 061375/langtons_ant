# Langton's Ant

Based on the algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant

It behaves as expected running into the highway at around 10000 iterations.

I included a version I created with 3 dimensions in this repository that seems to find a highway immediately or never based on one factor.

It uses WebGL and requires Three.js https://threejs.org/

I did not include the library in the repo.
